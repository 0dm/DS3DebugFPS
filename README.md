# DS3DebugFps
Unlock the frame rate in Dark Souls III. 

This project is open source and written in C.

# Installation
Move D3DCompiler_43.dll and fps.txt into your game directory.

Enter your desired framerate limit on the first line of fps.txt (default is 1000)

# Is it safe to use online?
Yes, there's a very low chance that this bans.

2020/8/1: Users have reported that the mod is safe to use online without penalization, but please use it at your own discretion!

# Borderless
This will not work in full screen mode, you will need to be in windowed mode (manually set it in game). This DLL will attempt to fullscreen the game in borderless window mode - it will fit screen too!

# Compatibility
Users of PyreProtecc will find that this DLL shares the same name as PyreProtecc, resulting in them being incompatible (it's late and I can't chain them). **PyreProtecc V5 will include all of this anywway.**

# **Yes, you could just use the public Dark Souls III cheat table to achieve this.**
