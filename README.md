# Dark-Souls-3-FPS-Unlock-Borderless
Unlock the frame rate in Dark Souls III. 

This project is open source and written in C.

# Installation
Move D3DCompiler_43.dll and fps.txt into your game directory.

Enter your desired framerate limit on the first line of fps.txt (default is 1000)

# Borderless
This will not work in full screen mode, you will need to be in windowed mode. This DLL will attempt to fullscreen the game in borderless window mode - it will fit screen too!

# Compatibility
Users of PyreProtecc will find that this DLL shares the same name as PyreProtecc, resulting in them being incompatible (it's late and I can't chain them). **PyreProtecc V5 will include all of this anywway.**

# **Yes, you could just use the public Dark Souls III cheat table to achieve this.**
